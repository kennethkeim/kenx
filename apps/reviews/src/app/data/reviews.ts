      "This place may be good for adults not for children.The door to the basement is sliding. It was really easy to slide and located in the living room.My 2-year-old fell from stairs where there was no handrail that she could reach. She had to go through elbow surgery. This trip became a nightmare for our family. You cannot turn on the heater more than 72 degrees. I felt colder and the comforters were very thin.I didn't feel the neighborhood was safe, not well-maintained.I could smell pee in the shower. I felt like the house was partly clean. The table in the kitchen was not cleaned. I do not recommend this place.",

There is a $200 deposit with MANY rules that you have to sign an additional contract for. Also, we did have to pay to check in only an hour earlier and the code was provided was incorrect. [Host] did correct this error relatively quickly. There was limited parking, however, this was warned about in the listing. Overall decent stay!',

There are 2 bedrooms on the second floor plus the bathroom and the upstairs has 2 beds.  There were 4 of us and we were all very comfortable.   We felt safe (it was 4 women) and, as [Host] mentioned, when we checked in we parked right in front of the unit but after our night out we had to park at the end of the block, but it was a very short walk.   The communication from the host is fantastic, including specific instructions on check in and check out.  We would definitely stay with this host again!',

They play very loud music. They didn‚Äôt stop til 2am when we stayed. The floor on the first floor was pretty dirty. I was walking in bare feet and my feet were black. I also cleaned up spilled water with a paper towel and afterwards turned it over and the paper towel was black with dirt.They had all the amenities (conditioner, shampoo, towels, coffee, creamer, sheets) which were a great touch and the couch was extremely comfy.It was a good price that was able to accommodate all of us.',

The courtyard out back was gorgeous and would have been nice to enjoy it in the evenings expect the neighborhood is very loud. Most people in the neighborhood were hanging out either on their front stoops or in the back alley with music playing very loud. We were told by one of the neighbors that the handicap parking is only for the residents of that street, even though we had a window tag.",

      'This rental is super charming and had everything you could possibly need from hair dryer to extra blankets, shaving cream/razors, coffee k cups, creamer and sugar. The unit was extremely clean‚Ä¶I was amazed how spotless it was. We only stayed for 1 night but we felt right at home inside the unit. Communication from the owner was great and he responded promptly within minutes when I couldn‚Äôt work the ac unit. Prior to my check in, I received loads of information and answers to any question that I may have. Only downfall to this rental is the location. It is a very dumpy neighborhood and we felt very uncomfortable parking a block or two away and walking up to the rental with our luggage. There were lots of neighbors outside staring at us and we felt very out of place. While I can not attest to the actual safety and crime of the neighborhood, I can say that we did not feel safe being outside. This would be a 5 star rental, but I had to take off a star for the neighborhood.',

(If they don‚Äôt mind walking to the top and sleeping alone) The neighborhood was pretty quiet during our one night stay. It‚Äôs an urban area and houses are adjoining. The owner added little touches to the apartment that made it very quaint and pleasurable during our stay. There were magazines, games, light snacks, and toiletries in the bathroom. We had one issue with the AC which we communicated with the owner. The owner seems very reasonable and will respond quickly to any issues any other renters would have as he did in our case.',

Is she okay to stop by the AirBnB when we come back to freshen up?"\n\nMessage from [Host]\n[Host]10:20 AM\n"We usually ask for them to be added\nIt would be $20 per person\nIf she just stays a minute okay sure don‚Äôt worry about it but if they come to visit we ask for it to be treated as a guest which is the $20\nCool?"\n\nMessage from [Guest]\n[Guest]10:24 AM\n"Yeah it will only be short ten minute probably nothing long"\n\nMessage from [Host]\n[Host]10:25 AM\n"I‚Äôm not trying to be hard but 10 minutes usually turns into 30 mins and so much more üòÄ"\n\nOn the backyard you are right we could do better. We have a plan to make it better. However to say it has not been maintained for a  year is inaccurate. We were just in there a few weeks ago. But yes I take your feedback. We should add some more attrative features.',

      'The good - the location was close to the city and house was clean and nicely decorated. The city has plenty to do for a 2-to-3 day getaway. The host responds quickly to questionsThe not-so-good - we had booked this place in part to do some grilling as part of Memorial Day weekend. Unfortunately, the grill grates were extensively rusty (not something that could just be scrubbed off). The host had a poor attitude about the whole ordeal and brushed off our concern with a "you\'ll be fine" which left a bad impression. Further, he was difficult to work with regarding any sort of recourse for the state of the grill - we ended up going to a restaurant instead and paying more than we otherwise would have grillingOther neutral things of note: the host will ask you submit your photo ID through a separate non-AirBnB verification system (I have personally not encountered this with previous bookings). The host will also pass along a $20 "cleaning fee" if you request the possibility of checking in 1 hour earlier than stated',

The house was quite a bit larger than we expected, and we had plenty of room for hanging out and playing games around the table. Although we did not use them, there was a washer and drier in the basement which looked easy to use, as well as a beautiful patio behind the house. It was a wonderful place to wake up on Sunday morning with the sunlight coming through the windows, and the house was super clean and organized for us when we arrived. There was room to prepare food in the kitchen, with all the dishes and utensils we could have needed. Aside from the parking being a little difficult due to its location in the city, we had no complaints, and we had no problems at all with noisy neighbors. The TV and wifi worked well, and there was enough hot water for everyone to shower. Overall, we loved our stay in Lancaster and would do again at [Host]'s place. Thanks for a great stay!",

      'The home was very stylishly redone, it was clean, the backyard is lovely. We stayed with young children and we didn‚Äôt feel comfortable walking the neighborhood but everyone we did pass outside the home was very friendly. There was thoughtful things left like toothbrush kits and coffee creamers. Great WiFi connection and the home was very quiet. Minimal street noise which is a plus for a city home. Thank you for hosting us!',

      'This was a great place to stay for our group of adults and kids - lots of beds and bedroom space, with privacy for everyone. The home was clean, well-equipped, and very comfortable - including the gorgeous back yard. [Host] was an excellent host who was very responsive. Neighborhood was vibrant and friendly and we had no problems with street parking. We would happily stay there again!',

      'Really great place to stay. Tons of space - 3 floors to spread out in. Very clean, cozy and homey feel. [Host] was very responsive, especially since we needed a place to stay in a pinch. We booked 3 hrs before checking in with absolutely no issues. Loved the back yard and coffee provided. We ended up getting a parking spot right out front easily. Location is a quick Uber to attractions/nightlife. Neighborhood was okay.. probably wouldn‚Äôt walk around at night. Call it an ‚Äúup and coming‚Äù neighborhood, but that made this place truly a ‚Äúdiamond in the rough‚Äù for amazing value and excellent stay overall.',
