  'This spot was lovely, clean, and central to lots Lancaster has to offer. A short jaunt to a lovely park for walking or running. This host really stood out in terms of communication - every question was answered before we even knew we had it, the policies and procedures were all clearly outlined and the unit provided everything we needed for our stay. Thank you for a great visit!!',

  'HeatherJanuary 2023',
  "Overall it was a fine stay. The neighbors were quite noisy with their music, and we found the floors not completely clean. The beds were comfortable, nice towels, and enough lighting. Found it difficult to use the bathroom sink, and the windows didn't seem fully sealed (we could hear the traffic).",
  'Response from ElamJanuary 2023Appreciate this Heather! We are pleased to have you.',
  'MarieJanuary 2023',
  'This is a peaceful area. A wonderful park nearby. Walking distance to the downtown of Lancaster.  Nice place.  I  feel like I was home. A 3 bedrooms apartment  just for me.  The price was affordable. I  will recommend this place to anyone.  Thanks',
  'Response from ElamJanuary 2023Wow, thank you Marie. Visit us again soon!',

  "This place may be good for adults not for children.The door to the basement is sliding. It was really easy to slide and located in the living room.My 2-year-old fell from stairs where there was no handrail that she could reach. She had to go through elbow surgery. This trip became a nightmare for our family. You cannot turn on the heater more than 72 degrees. I felt colder and the comforters were very thin.I didn't feel the neighborhood was safe, not well-maintained.I could smell pee in the shower. I felt like the house was partly clean. The table in the kitchen was not cleaned. I do not recommend this place.",

  'AsiaNovember 2022',
  'It was great!',
  'AllisonNovember 2022',
  'This place was convenient to downtown and sight and sound theater, clean and as expected based on pictures, but was in row housing, which didn‚Äôt matter to our group, but may for you. There is a $200 deposit with MANY rules that you have to sign an additional contract for. Also, we did have to pay to check in only an hour earlier and the code was provided was incorrect. Elam did correct this error relatively quickly. There was limited parking, however, this was warned about in the listing. Overall decent stay!',
  'RitaOctober 2022',
  'This townhome was very comfortable and convenient.  It had a nice living room area with plenty of seating, a full sized dining room table and a fully equipped kitchen.  There are 2 bedrooms on the second floor plus the bathroom and the upstairs has 2 beds.  There were 4 of us and we were all very comfortable.   We felt safe (it was 4 women) and, as Elam mentioned, when we checked in we parked right in front of the unit but after our night out we had to park at the end of the block, but it was a very short walk.   The communication from the host is fantastic, including specific instructions on check in and check out.  We would definitely stay with this host again!',

  'Place is gorgeous, clean, and has plenty of beds. We loved that there were towels set out for everyone, and also toiletries in the bathroom. Excellent price as well. We walked into town, and at the end of the night ubered home. Feel like we found a gem in Lancaster!',
  'AmandaSeptember 2022',
  'Cozy place, easy access. Street parking only but didn‚Äôt cause an issue for us. Overall, it was an easy stay for 1 night!',
  'DavidSeptember 2022',
  'Good: communication from the host was immediate, descriptive, and kind. The decor and furnishings were astonishingly beautiful.Bad: the place had a wet, musty scent every floor so I had trouble breathing. The neighborhood was unbelievably loud, playing music until midnight. Very loud drivers passing by, and heavy party.',
  'DianaSeptember 2022',
  'Cute little place. Enough space to accommodate all 9 of us. Only one bathroom but luckily it wasn‚Äôt ever an issue for us. The biggest downside to this rental are the neighbors. They play very loud music. They didn‚Äôt stop til 2am when we stayed. The floor on the first floor was pretty dirty. I was walking in bare feet and my feet were black. I also cleaned up spilled water with a paper towel and afterwards turned it over and the paper towel was black with dirt.They had all the amenities (conditioner, shampoo, towels, coffee, creamer, sheets) which were a great touch and the couch was extremely comfy.It was a good price that was able to accommodate all of us.',

  'JimAugust 2022',
  "Elam's place was the last leg of our road trip. We were able to find parking on the street, and the inside of the home is lovely. There were extra air mattresses, and it was close to the Sight and Sound Theater which was our final attraction for the last leg of our trip.",

  'This was a great place to relax for the night! Loved the vibes',
  'GershonAugust 2022',
  'Excellent',
  'LizAugust 2022',
  "I've been struggling with the right words to say for this review. First off the inside of the row house was beautifully redone. The courtyard out back was gorgeous and would have been nice to enjoy it in the evenings expect the neighborhood is very loud. Most people in the neighborhood were hanging out either on their front stoops or in the back alley with music playing very loud. We were told by one of the neighbors that the handicap parking is only for the residents of that street, even though we had a window tag.",
  'BenjaminAugust 2022',
  'Nice value and lots of room for guests!',

  'It was a great stay! Very nice house!',
  'ShaynaJuly 2022',
  'This was a great place to stay with plenty of space for multiple guests! Elam was great in his communication leading up to and throughout our stay. The hosts did a great job in making this home comfortable and had obviously done work to update the homes features. I loved the bathroom sink!! It is less than 10 minutes from downtown Lancaster which was perfect. I would recommend this to anyone looking for an affordable place to stay in Lancaster!',
  'PrinceJuly 2022',
  'Great spacious place with a nice private backyard. Great location within walking distance of downtown. Highly recommend!',
  'ChristineJuly 2022',
  'This rental is super charming and had everything you could possibly need from hair dryer to extra blankets, shaving cream/razors, coffee k cups, creamer and sugar. The unit was extremely clean‚Ä¶I was amazed how spotless it was. We only stayed for 1 night but we felt right at home inside the unit. Communication from the owner was great and he responded promptly within minutes when I couldn‚Äôt work the ac unit. Prior to my check in, I received loads of information and answers to any question that I may have. Only downfall to this rental is the location. It is a very dumpy neighborhood and we felt very uncomfortable parking a block or two away and walking up to the rental with our luggage. There were lots of neighbors outside staring at us and we felt very out of place. While I can not attest to the actual safety and crime of the neighborhood, I can say that we did not feel safe being outside. This would be a 5 star rental, but I had to take off a star for the neighborhood.',
  'ChristopherJuly 2022',
  'This apartment is great for small families. The two bedrooms on the second level sate great for two couples. The upstairs bedroom is good for children or singles. (If they don‚Äôt mind walking to the top and sleeping alone) The neighborhood was pretty quiet during our one night stay. It‚Äôs an urban area and houses are adjoining. The owner added little touches to the apartment that made it very quaint and pleasurable during our stay. There were magazines, games, light snacks, and toiletries in the bathroom. We had one issue with the AC which we communicated with the owner. The owner seems very reasonable and will respond quickly to any issues any other renters would have as he did in our case.',

  'Response from ElamJune 2022Awesome feedback. Thank you. It will help our future guests to decide. :)',
  'ShannonJune 2022',
  'The location was great and the interior is really cute. Nice backyard and plenty of room for 9of us(5 teens, 3 adults, 1 child). However, the housekeeper that they hired did not do their job. It might not be the host but they need to manage their housekeeper well to maintain their place up to their description of the place.',
  'Response from ElamJune 2022I am very very sorry Shannon. What can we do to make this right?',
  'RicardoJune 2022',
  'Ever looking for a house rental this is a choice‚Ä¶ includes quiet neighborhood, clean house, laundry,  plenty of supplies for kitchen and etc . 10/10 RECOMMENDED',

  'Our trip was just for one night which prevented us from exploring Lancaster city. Our children really enjoyed the accommodations.',
  'RhodaApril 2022',
  'The house was very clean and d√©cor nice. But I  recommend you get a specific agreement that there will be beds for your amount of guests. Elam went to great lengths to explain to me, that the amount of guests he advertises for, is not  the amount of sleeping space he provides. I will give him credit, he did give a small discount.',
  'LuisMarch 2022',

  'Elam‚Äôs house was great! Very clean, comfy beds & nice extras such as bath toiletries & such. The only downfall was location. While it is in the city, you are not able to walk to restaurants, coffee shops & such. The area is not ‚Äúkid friendly‚Äù when it comes to safety & walking around at night. Other than that it was a great stay! Thanks again!',
  "Response from ElamMarch 2022Thank you for staying with us Susan, sorry about the safety issues,  if it makes it better, we haven't had any reported cases with guests though.  We look forward to hosting you again soon! Stay Safe!",

  'ElizabethJanuary 2022',
  "It's a comfortable, well-appointed spot on a fairly quiet street. A nice place to spend a couple of days. We were disappointed that we arrived 15 minutes early and couldn't get inside yet. I was told there was a $20 fee for every hour you wish to enter prior to check-in.  It was 12 degrees outside. We sat in the car for 15 minutes waiting for the door code to work as the clock struck 4pm.",
  "Response from ElamFebruary 2022I am so sorry Elizabeth, our doors are synched to the check-in time. And the charge for an early check-in is because we need to pay for the cleaners to expedite the cleaning. We'd love to have you again, come back anytime!",
  'ErinJanuary 2022',
  'The Kingly House is just such an amazing spot to stay! We were able to comfortably sleep 5 and with plenty of room to spare! Definitely coming back next time around!',

  'This was our families first time at an Air BNB. There was a lot of worry doing so over Thanksgiving where a traditional feast was expected by all. The property worked out perfect for the family all the rooms were great to relax in. The kitchen big enough and stocked well so we could make dinner and have our daughter who lives in PA over to enjoy on the large table. We üíØ recommend this property to anyone needing a nice place to stay. I saw other reviews with concern over the neighborhood and parking we did not have any issues with either.',

  'MelodyOctober 2021',
  'Such a cute place! Something that would make it a little better would be to freshen it up. Some pillows and towels and the floor could‚Äôve used another wash/wipe down. We had everything we needed though with toiletries and plenty of other amenities. Check in was smooth. There‚Äôs a book for guests which brings a little more life to the place üòä Elam provided all the information we needed for our stay. I absolutely love the uniqueness of every home in that area. The Central Lancaster Market was lovely and nice that it was close by.',
  'KimOctober 2021',
  "I travel alot and I tend to rent with Airbnb hosts. I have to the Kingsley family had the best communication I've experienced with Airbnb hosts. They're home was warm,cozy and inviting and I would refer them to anyone looking to stay at a five star residence with five star service! Thank you again and God Bless!!!",

  'Great place, great neighbors.  Everything it says it is üëä',
  'ChrisOctober 2021',
  'The house itself is very nice and is as pictured. Elam is incredibly attentive to messages and tries to help as he can. As others have mentioned, charged extra for flexibility of getting into the house early, and then forgot to adjust the lock to let us in at predetermined time. Neighborhood does get a bit loud with cars throughout the night but nothing too bad. Also, the house doesn‚Äôt haven‚Äôt central air and the window units were taken out a bit too soon (tough decision but still not an enjoyable sleep in an 80 degree house.) Clean up kind of asked for a lot but nothing ridiculous. Overall it was a fine stay that could‚Äôve been improved with some better attention to detail and understanding from host.',
  'Response from ElamOctober 2021Hi Chris, thank you for the great review. We noted of your suggestions, this is much appreciated. Till your next visit!',
  'SethOctober 2021',
  'Beautiful Airbnb and great communication by Elam.Pros: Beautiful and clean Airbnb, fast responses by the hosts, close to hotspots in Lancaster. Cons: not a great neighborhood, loud music that can be heard in block behind. House rules are a little stricter than usual, but manageable. Overall had a good stay.',

  'AjitSeptember 2021',
  'First of all, the location of this Airbnb is not great. When we reached the airbnb, neighbors stared us like we were aliens while playing loud music which sacred some members of our family. We were also locked out for sometime outside our place in the middle of night and it was scary.However, the house itself was very beautiful and cozy inside. It had all the amenities and we enjoyed our stay.',

  'SarahSeptember 2021',
  'Great Airbnb! The location is in a less nice part of Lancaster but you wouldn‚Äôt notice based on how the Airbnb looked. Very clean and a nice outdoor patio. Me and my friends stayed there after a wedding and it was perfect. Elam was a great communicator and made the process go so smooth. A good place if you are looking for an Airbnb that fits a bigger group of people!',

  'MichaelAugust 2021',
  'City realness.  Gentrified but not too much.  Loved the family vibe of this neighborhood.',
  'MiriAugust 2021',
  'Cute home to stay in. We lucked out finding parking but it seems like it could be difficult to park close to house. The back door was open when we arrived (after 8:00 pm) and would not close. I contacted Elam and he was there in 30 min to fix it. Overall a good night-though the master bed does squeak with every movement which was a bit bothersome for a restless sleeper. Thanks Elam for the great communication',
  'JennaAugust 2021',
  'Wonderful last minute stay! Host was super communicative and helpful, thank you Elam and family!',
  'BreezillaAugust 2021',
  'Nice, cozy little spot for family and friends coming together. Elam was good communicating and if you read up on update info he sends it pretty much covers any questions you might have ahead of time - though he was decently prompt regarding any concerns! I did let him know about a loose shower knob which I was grateful he didn‚Äôt turn to pin on us during our stay :) We enjoyed our short stay there and used the kitchen for a big breakfast with fam and friends next morning before heading to Hershey Park!',
  'EddieAugust 2021',
  "Pros: Great location that's close to downtown; charming home; well supplied; nice TV with access to many streaming services; nice patio. Elam was receptive to feedback.Cons: Property was not ready for check in at the agreed time; some cleaning was not completed; parking is extremely difficult and parking restrictions are onerous; there was major street construction and street closures during our stay; major potholes all around the neighborhood. Significant amount of litter in the neighborhood; playground nearby has broken equipment, rusted, and overall not safe for little kids. Neighbors were having a loud party until 2 or 3am; very loud.",
  'MarciaAugust 2021',
  'Elam is great! Everything we needed was provided! My family really enjoyed their stay! Elam‚Äôs communication is awesome! FYI the Hersey Park is 40 minutes away from this location. Be mindful of the parking rules!',
  'JulieAugust 2021',
  'Beautiful, clean and exactly what we needed! Check in was a breeze and communicating with the host was easy and informative. We were only in town for one night for a wedding but we would definitely stay again if we needed something in the area.',
  'AnthonyAugust 2021',
  'The neighbors were cool everything it‚Äôs close by so if you need to go out and get something everything was clean and nice we love staying there will be back',
  'StellaAugust 2021',
  'My eight family members & I tremendously enjoy the house.  The house was clean.  There were so many amenities provided.  The backyard was a pleasure and private.  The rooms were spacious enough.  Everything was decorated nicely.  We had such a good time and would recommend to anyone.',
  'SydneyJuly 2021',
  'Our stay was wonderful! There is street parking in front of the house and on the streets adjacent to the house. Parking was never an issue. The house was even better than the pictures indicated. Elam and family have thought of everything. They have dental kits and shaving kits just in case you are in a pinch. He also left out a few snacks. The only problem we had, was the house smelled a bit like cigarettes when we first walked in. The smell eventually went away and wasn‚Äôt a problem but something to note. Everything else was wonderful!',

  'DanaeJuly 2021',
  'This house is clean and spacious. There\'s easy access to both downtown Lancaster and the surrounding area. Elam was a responsive host and the eco bath items and welcome basket were lovely touches. The neighborhood was a little more questionable. We experienced this "up and coming" neighborhood on the weekend. The neighbors threw a party which lasted well into the morning hours and which kept waking my infant up. parking was also a challenge on the weekend.',
  'ClaytonJuly 2021',
  'The house was very cute and nicely maintained. It was perfect for my family of six. We loved the neighborhood too. It was very friendly and convenient to things we wanted to do in Lancaster.',

  'This house was perfect!  Lots of space, clean, adorable, easy, comfortable!  Street parking was not a problem at all!  We loved the backyard as well!  Elam was very communicative!  We will definitely stay again, and recommend to others!',
  'Hsuan WenJuly 2021',
  'A cozy clean place. But the room faced the street will easily hear the sounds outside and the neighbors were talking through the midnight in Friday night. Other than that, everything is perfect.',

  'For the most part this was a good spot. It‚Äôs a pretty noisy block if you‚Äôre not used to cars & motorcycles zooming down the street at all hour of the night/day. Was disappointed in the backyard.. the listing photos do not reflect how it looks. We had an incident where someone decided to come for the day but we hadn‚Äôt registered them and they wanted to charge us $20 for them to stop in for 10min. There‚Äôs is a long list of rules and things for you to do as a guest, you will miss something even if you read them and it will probably cost you unfortunately with these Hosts. - very bummed, the only super host I e had a problem with in my entire time staying at AirBnBs!',
  'Response from ElamJuly 2021hmmm sorry about your frustration. It feels however a bit unfair regarding your review\n\nHere is the conversation that we had. Plus we also were duper duper clear about how it works beforehand. It seemed to me, although I could be wrong, that you were hoping to slip in another person and get away with it. Again I may be wrong. But here is what was said. \n\nMessage from Nicole\nNicole10:18 AM\n"Question for you - our 6th girl is coming in for the day‚Ä¶. Is she okay to stop by the AirBnB when we come back to freshen up?"\n\nMessage from Elam\nElam10:20 AM\n"We usually ask for them to be added\nIt would be $20 per person\nIf she just stays a minute okay sure don‚Äôt worry about it but if they come to visit we ask for it to be treated as a guest which is the $20\nCool?"\n\nMessage from Nicole\nNicole10:24 AM\n"Yeah it will only be short ten minute probably nothing long"\n\nMessage from Elam\nElam10:25 AM\n"I‚Äôm not trying to be hard but 10 minutes usually turns into 30 mins and so much more üòÄ"\n\nOn the backyard you are right we could do better. We have a plan to make it better. However to say it has not been maintained for a  year is inaccurate. We were just in there a few weeks ago. But yes I take your feedback. We should add some more attrative features.',
  'CarrieJune 2021',
  'The place was really great - a perfect size/setup for our family of 5. We didn‚Äôt have any issues with neighborhood noise (maybe because we were there from a Sunday - Friday) but it was perfectly fine. Parking was not an issue either. So glad to have found this option.',

  'The good - the location was close to the city and house was clean and nicely decorated. The city has plenty to do for a 2-to-3 day getaway. The host responds quickly to questionsThe not-so-good - we had booked this place in part to do some grilling as part of Memorial Day weekend. Unfortunately, the grill grates were extensively rusty (not something that could just be scrubbed off). The host had a poor attitude about the whole ordeal and brushed off our concern with a "you\'ll be fine" which left a bad impression. Further, he was difficult to work with regarding any sort of recourse for the state of the grill - we ended up going to a restaurant instead and paying more than we otherwise would have grillingOther neutral things of note: the host will ask you submit your photo ID through a separate non-AirBnB verification system (I have personally not encountered this with previous bookings). The host will also pass along a $20 "cleaning fee" if you request the possibility of checking in 1 hour earlier than stated',

  'Lovely place! Highly recommended!',
  'AnnMay 2021',
  'Home is updated with nice decor. The home is clean and well stocked with necessities. However, if early entry is desired look elsewhere. Elan charged extra for 2 pm entry and did not program the door lock to open until 2:30pm. We stood on the front porch for 20 minutes trying to get in and Elam was no help.',

  'JeremyFebruary 2021',
  'What a hidden gem! We considered farmstays, hotels, B&B‚Äôs, and other Lancaster options, but we‚Äôre so glad we settled on Elam‚Äôs place. Every choice they made, from curb appeal to the decorative touches to the comfy beds was spot on. We got hit with a snow day in the middle of our trip and couldn‚Äôt leave the house, and we loved it! The place is cozy, we loved the board games, and movie night on the big comfy sectional was a hit. Elam kept us informed every step of the way, and always came through on what he promised. First rate place. First rate host. Would highly recommend.',
  'JeffreyFebruary 2021',
  'This AirBnB is a very nice place to spend a getaway weekend. The place was clean and spacious. All the amenities imaginable were provided with the stay. There were even dental kits, shaving kits, and extra soap bars if needed. Very nice touch. Elam was a great host and provided very detailed instructions to make the entire stay as easy and stress free as possible. He was very quick to respond when we had any type of questions. Overall, I very much enjoyed my stay here and would stay if given the chance again.',

The house itself is extremely well done with thoughtful amenities; Elam is very responsive and helpful; the region is great to explore.  (My one tip to other travelers is to check out Lititz!; its a little German town that is like a trip back in time!).  Thanks to Elam, and hope others can enjoy as well.',

  'HudsonNovember 2020',
  'This place was perfect for our family of 6. Elam was so thoughtful with the snacks, waters, and wonderful bath soaps. The kid friendly dinner wear was such an useful addition since our oldest is 7. We didn‚Äôt set these up but there was also a pack-and-play and air mattress. Highly recommend Elam and this place for any bookings.',

  'Response from ElamOctober 2020Sorry Monica that you felt that way. And I can understand. Its a little bit of a fine line with the house rules frankly. Some folks you need to make them very strict for them to even begin to pay attention. Bu tthen the danger is that some more sensible people like yourself take them to seriously. That is not our intent. \n\nThanks for being a great guest.',

It felt like home for sure.The decor of the house was cozy and very well designed. Definitely a gem and we will book again.',

  "The house was easy to find and easy to access, and we truly enjoyed our stay. The house was quite a bit larger than we expected, and we had plenty of room for hanging out and playing games around the table. Although we did not use them, there was a washer and drier in the basement which looked easy to use, as well as a beautiful patio behind the house. It was a wonderful place to wake up on Sunday morning with the sunlight coming through the windows, and the house was super clean and organized for us when we arrived. There was room to prepare food in the kitchen, with all the dishes and utensils we could have needed. Aside from the parking being a little difficult due to its location in the city, we had no complaints, and we had no problems at all with noisy neighbors. The TV and wifi worked well, and there was enough hot water for everyone to shower. Overall, we loved our stay in Lancaster and would do again at Elam's place. Thanks for a great stay!",

The only thing worth mentioning is that the location was meh. Totally safe, but there isn't really anything to do in the city unless you walk about a mile from the house. This was ideal for us because we like to walk a lot, but it's worth noting for people who like to be where the action is.",

  "This was a really nicely re-done row house with nice style and great amenities.  Very clean, tons of available sheets and blankets, and even some extra toothbrushes that came in handy when we realized we left my son's at home. Great space for families because the kids can have the 3rd floor bedroom and parents can hang out in the living room at night.  Elam was an impeccable host and very responsive.  I will say that one member of my party was uncomfy with the neighborhood, but we never had any problems.  And we did have to park a block away at night, but it wasn't awful.  Ultimately a good experience and a lovely house.",

  'An outstanding stay and value! Extremely clean and updated interior. Very comfortable and plenty of space to spread out. We were there for a mother/daughter weekend, and our 14-year old daughters loved having their own space up on the third level...which was great when the moms wanted to go to bed. Would definitely recommend!',

  "Highly recommend staying at Elams place. Everything was just as described, we really enjoyed ourselves. He even went out of his way to call and make sure everything was good and if we needed anything. House was clean and inviting. Hardest part was finding parking but even that wasn't bad. We will be returning in the future.",

  'Elam‚Äôs Place was cute and eclectic. He was very communicative. It was nice to have a kitchen to use so we didn‚Äôt have to eat out and the space as clean with all the amenities and toiletries you‚Äôd need. The neighbors were kind of loud and it didn‚Äôt always feel like the best part of town. Elam also seemed a little money hungry. I requested a late check out and he wanted to charge us an extra $20 for an hour because of expedited cleaning. We declined but because I locked my keys in the car we were waiting outside his place that hour anyways and the cleaner wasn‚Äôt even there. I‚Äôm a host too so I get it, but it just seemed he had a price tag attached to everything. Overall a easy place to sleep for the price.',
  'Response from ElamDecember 2019Thank you for your feedback and sorry about the neighbors being loud. I‚Äôm sure it was frustrating. I wish that you had notified me and I would immediately have addressed it.I‚Äôm sorry that it felt to you like I was money hungry. That was not my intent. After having read multiple hosts position on charging for late checkout and hearing opposing side, my wife and I decided that the fairest thing and best way forward for everyone is to charge for late checkout. I totally understand and respect a different position. But it feels unfair to me to call me out on it when we do it across the board and I am clear about it and give the option to accept or reject.I‚Äôm a little confused though as a charge for late checkout is one thing but you said a price tag on everything. I can‚Äôt remember anything else. Unfortunately you may have missed the cleaning lady as she was inside cleaning when you were outside. She arrived shortly after you left.',

We stayed with young children and we didn‚Äôt feel comfortable walking the neighborhood but everyone we did pass outside the home was very friendly. There was thoughtful things left like toothbrush kits and coffee creamers. Great WiFi connection and the home was very quiet. Minimal street noise which is a plus for a city home.

The home was clean, well-equipped, and very comfortable - including the gorgeous back yard. Elam was an excellent host who was very responsive. Neighborhood was vibrant and friendly and we had no problems with street parking. We would happily stay there again!',
  'PaulSeptember 2019',
  'Really great place to stay. Tons of space - 3 floors to spread out in. Very clean, cozy and homey feel. Elam was very responsive, especially since we needed a place to stay in a pinch. We booked 3 hrs before checking in with absolutely no issues. Loved the back yard and coffee provided. We ended up getting a parking spot right out front easily. Location is a quick Uber to attractions/nightlife. Neighborhood was okay.. probably wouldn‚Äôt walk around at night. Call it an ‚Äúup and coming‚Äù neighborhood, but that made this place truly a ‚Äúdiamond in the rough‚Äù for amazing value and excellent stay overall.',
