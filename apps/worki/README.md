# What

It's a Pomodoro-ish timer app built with React Native.

The timer is quite opinionated and I made it for my own personal use, so not a lot of config options.

In the unlikely event anyone ever reads this, feel free to fork it.

# What but more detailed

- Timer is always running if app is open, cannot be paused
- Timer starts top of the hour
- Timer is 5 intro, 55 focus, 5 retro
- One of the 5 min blocks will include prompts to exercise, probably the retro block
- Exercise will include: carpal-tunnel-prevention exercises, whole-body exercises, pranamat, etc
- Exercises will be highly optimized for the equipment I own and the problems I'm trying to solve
